I"Á<p> I've always found it cool that you can have a Network Attached Storage to access the same files through any deivce on the network. Who wouldn't like technology to make their life easier? I mean, it is a massive pain to keep connecting flash drives to transfer data between devices. <br />
This architecture of a centralized network gives me the advantage of having my own media center and also allows me to store static files in the server
