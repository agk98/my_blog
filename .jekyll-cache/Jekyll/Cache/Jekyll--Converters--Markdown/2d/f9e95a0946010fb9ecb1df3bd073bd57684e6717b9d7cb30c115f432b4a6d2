I"Ú<p> My brother gifted me a Raspberry Pi 3 a couple of months back. After tinkering around with it for a few days, I kept it aside because I couldn't think of any use case for it that would benefit me everyday. This was until I learned about NAS and its technologies in one of my courses at college.</p>
<p> I found it really cool that you can have a Network Attached Storage to access the same files through any deivce on the network. This would allow me to finally have a centralized storage to host a media center and also store some static files and documents. Also, there is an added benefit that this data is always on my own network and can ensure a larger Ever since then, I have been playing with the idea of building a NAS using my pi. I managed to set it up in less than a day. And it's been a huge help at home. </p>
<p> I could gone with using OpenMediaVault ( a NAS solution based on Debian Linux) which would set up the NAS for me without me having to do all the heavy lifting. But, where's the fun in taht? So, I took out my black hoodie and did what every professional programmer does. I googled for answers to all my questions. And in a couple of hours, I was done with setting up my very own NAS using the Raspberry Pi.</p>
