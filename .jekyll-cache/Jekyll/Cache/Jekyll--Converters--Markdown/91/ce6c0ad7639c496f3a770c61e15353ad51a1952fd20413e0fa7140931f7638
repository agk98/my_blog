I"Ø<p> I've always found it cool that you can have a Network Attached Storage to access the same files through any deivce on the network. Who wouldn't like technology to make their life easier? I mean, it is a massive pain to keep connecting flash drives to transfer data between devices. <br />
This architecture of a centralized network gives me the advantage of having my own media center and also allows me to store static files without worrying too much about it. </p>
<p> My brother gifted me a Raspberry Pi 3 a couple of months back. After tinkering around with it for a few days, I kept it aside because I couldn't think of any use case for it that would benefit me everyday. This was until I learned about NAS and its technologies in one of my courses at college. Ever since then, I have been playing with the idea of building a NAS using my pi. I managed to set it up in less than a day. And it's been a huge help at home. </p>
