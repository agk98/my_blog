I"–<p><b>Me on a monday morning:</b> <i>*log's in*</i>
<br /><b>Also me:</b> Ugh! I hate this wallpaper!</p>
<p> Okay, I admit that i'm being too dramatic about this. Although, it isn't really that far from true. I am notorious for constantly getting bored of my wallpaper every few days. Yes, I am one of those people who has to constantly change their wallpaper just to get the day going. My go-to source for wallpapers is <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank">Unsplash</a>. I love images that are vibrant and have a lot of minute details. Very original, I know!</p>
<p> While I was on my last wallpaper hunt, I thought of an idea to automate this. By scheduling a change of wallpaper to happen every now and then, I could avoid the otherwise annoying task of hunting for a new one and then setting it. My mom would be so disappointed if she knew i'd become this lazy.<br /> Moving on, Here's what I did!</p>
